			Hello! My name is Tupheng Lee and welcome to my little biography! A few things to know about me is that I was born on March 2nd, 2000 on an early evening day. Some intrest I have is that I love the culture of Japan because of their historical background. I also love to listen to music and have a hoodie collection that is growing ever so slowly. This is just a little taste of my life!</p>

			<p>I have lived in Minnesota my whole entire life, in fact I still live in the same old house and had never moved before. One of my hobbies is walking around my neighborhood when I have time.
			I have a deep connection with my neighborhood and would like to share some information about it!</p>
