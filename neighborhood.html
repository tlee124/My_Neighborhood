			Since I live next to a lake, I can always see something different everytime I go walking! I get to see all sorts of wild life around my home! I don't have any pets, but with all of these animal near I can say that I have a new pet everyday!

	 		Living next to a lake is so nice because I have such a great view of it and can walk there by foot in no time. The lake also has a park, though I am too old to really play on it, I just use the swings there.

			The only thing that I would like to get to know more about is the people who live in my neighborhood. Since we lived next to each other for so long I'm sure that we can jump that hurdle and say more than just hello to each other!

			I don't really like to take pictures of things, but I do like to capture the moments in nature so that I can see it again.
